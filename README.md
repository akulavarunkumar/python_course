## How to Install Python on Windows 10 


Installing and using Python on Windows 10 is very simple. The installation procedure involves just three steps:

- Add Python to PATH environmental variables

### Step1: Download the Python Installer binaries

### Step 3: Add Python to environmental variables
The last (optional) step in the installation process is to add Python Path to the System Environment variables. This step is done to access Python through the command line. In case you have added Python to environment variables while setting the Advanced options during the installation procedure, you can avoid this step. Else, this step is done manually as follows.

In the "Start menu" >> “advanced system settings” >> “View advanced system settings” >> 
      “System Properties” >> “Advanced" tab >> “Environment Variables” button. 
      Locate the Python installation directory on your system.
      **Append the installation directory path to PATH variable**
