# Python Installation Steps in Windows, Linux, Mac Operating Systems


## How to Install Python on Windows 


Installing and using Python on Windows 10 is very simple. The installation procedure involves just three steps:

- Download the binaries
- Run the Executable installer
- Add Python to PATH environmental variables

### Step1: Download the Python Installer binaries
Open the [official Python website](https://python.org/downloads/windows/) in your web browser. Navigate to the Downloads tab for Windows.
Choose the latest Python 3 release, download the exe file based on 64 or 32 bit machine or server.

Check the Install launcher for all users check box. Further, you may check the Add Python 3.7 to path check box to include the interpreter in the execution path.

### Step 3: Add Python to environmental variables
The last (optional) step in the installation process is to add Python Path to the System Environment variables. This step is done to access Python through the command line. In case you have added Python to environment variables while setting the Advanced options during the installation procedure, you can avoid this step. Else, this step is done manually as follows.

In the "Start menu" >> “advanced system settings” >> “View advanced system settings” >> 
      “System Properties” >> “Advanced" tab >> “Environment Variables” button. 
      Locate the Python installation directory on your system.
      **Append the installation directory path to PATH variable**

## How to Install Python on Mac
We need to follow same step as windows installation but using different commands

### Step1: Download the pkg files
Open the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads) in your web browser.
### Step2: Run the Executable Installer
Once the download is complete, double-click the package to start installing Python. The installer will walk you through a wizard to complete the installation, and in most cases, the default settings work well, so install it like the other applications on macOS. You may also have to enter your Mac password to let it know that you agree with installing Python.
